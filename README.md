## Description
This repository includes a variety of projects that cover fundamental concepts in C programming and low-level programming in general. The projects range from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics such as memory management, file I/O, and algorithm implementation.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific project or topic. Below is a brief overview of the directories:

* 0x00-hello_world: Introduction to C programming, including basic syntax and the compilation process.
* 0x01-variables_if_else_while: Projects on variables, control structures, and loops.
* 0x02-functions_nested_loops: Exercises on functions and nested loops.
* 0x03-debugging: Debugging techniques and tools.
* 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: More exercises on functions and nested loops.
* 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: Introduction to pointers, arrays, and strings.
* 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: More exercises on pointers, arrays, and strings.
* 0x07-recursion: Projects focusing on recursion.
* 0x08-static_libraries: Creating and using static libraries.
* 0x09-argc_argv: Handling command-line arguments.
* 0x0A-malloc_free: Dynamic memory allocation.
* 0x0B-more_malloc_free: More exercises on dynamic memory allocation.
* 0x0C-preprocessor: Understanding the C preprocessor.
* 0x0D-structures_typedef: Working with structures and typedef.
* 0x0E-function_pointers: Using function pointers.
* 0x0F-variadic_functions: Working with variadic functions.
* 0x10-printf: Implementation of the printf function.
* 0x11-singly_linked_lists: Introduction to singly linked lists.
* 0x12-more_singly_linked_lists: More exercises on singly linked lists.
* 0x13-bit_manipulation: Projects on bit manipulation.
* 0x14-file_io: File input and output operations.
Each directory contains source code files (.c), header files (.h), and README.md files specific to the projects within that directory.
